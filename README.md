  Hello everyone welcome to Sp@ce F@cts your new favorite space app.
 
  Sp@ce F@cts was started in April 2020 as educational school project.
 
  The site itself is educational and was created out of love  and hobbies. Its purpose is to share information about the universe. Page will be updated over time and i would like to keep the design as much as possible as it is right now. Nice simple black background with high resolution pictures to highlight all the beauty, intrigue and incredible appearance of some objects in space.

  I am thrilled that I can turn my passion and hobby into my own website. I hope you enjoy my web page as much as I enjoy presenting space facts to you all.

# UX

- Easily navigate the site across all pages.

- Enjoy viewing high quality pictures of space and objects.

- To see simple, clear design, which cleary shows what the user can do.

- Want to see what different category are included in content.

- Expect to know from where the content of the site came from.

- Be able to contact somebody about content,prise,critics,mistakes or any other topic.

## Design
This project was developed with a focus on a mobile approach first. However, with full responsiveness on other screen sizes.
I used the grids, nav, carousel and bootstrap colours in this project.
The main idea for the design of this project was to have a serious and professional appearance, transparent navbar, black background to highlight images of space objects, which convey sophistication and provide a pleasant user experience.
