  Hello everyone welcome to Sp@ce F@cts your new favorite space app.
 
  Sp@ce F@cts was started in April 2020 as educational school project.
 
  The site itself is educational and was created out of love  and hobbies. Its purpose is to share information about the universe. Site will be updated over time and i would like to keep the design as much as possible as it is right now. Nice simple black background with high resolution pictures to highlight all the beauty, intrigue and incredible appearance of some objects in space.

  I am thrilled that I can turn my passion and hobby into my own website. I hope you enjoy my web page as much as I enjoy presenting space facts to you all.

## Design
This project was developed with a focus on a mobile approach first. However, with full responsiveness on other screen sizes.
I used the grids, nav, cards, forms,table, carousel and bootstrap  in this project.
The main idea for the design of this project was to have a serious and professional appearance, transparent navbar, black background to highlight images of space objects, which convey sophistication and provide a pleasant user experience.

### Typography
The main font used in this project is **Robotto**. I think that's a well designed and easy to read font. An extra reason for using this font is the excellent display on small screens.
In the main titles of the site, the font **Girassol** was used, which also has a good design and combines nicely with the main font.

### Colours

- In the colour scheme, i used black, orange and white which combined together give me favoured the easy visualization of the information.

- Transparent rounded navbar with orange border and same style is used for footer to greater contrast and to get pleasant ux.

- Transparent callout section with white text and orange seperators for text and that style is constantly used through all pages.

- In the background, I used an black-blue image of the galaxy for callout section and black universe image for planet section which provide me great ground for planets to "float".

- The orange buttons continue and blend in with the black-and-orange design, changing the color to a lighter shade on hover.

### Icons

The icons used in this project are provided by [Font Awesome 5.12.1](https://fontawesome.com/).
They were used as social media icons in the footer and on contact page as adress,comment and map.

## Wireframes

These wireframes were designed with Balsamiq Mockups 3. These were the first version of scope and some  things have changed during the development for the final version.
