<h1>Sp@ce F@cts</h1>
</div>


  Hello everyone welcome to Sp@ce F@cts your new favorite space app.
 
  Sp@ce F@cts was started in April 2020 as educational school project.
 
  The site itself is educational and was created out of love  and hobbies. Its purpose is to share information about the universe. Site will be updated over time and i would like to keep the design as much as possible as it is right now. Nice simple black background with high resolution pictures to highlight all the beauty, intrigue and incredible appearance of some objects in space.

  I am thrilled that I can turn my passion and hobby into my own website. I hope you enjoy my web page as much as I enjoy presenting space facts to you all.

# UX

- Easily navigate the site across all pages.

- Enjoy viewing high quality pictures of space and objects.

## Design
This project was developed with a focus on a mobile approach first. However, with full responsiveness on other screen sizes.
I used the jumbotron, grids, nav, cards, forms, table, carousel and bootstrap  in this project.
The main idea for the design of this project was to have a serious and professional appearance, transparent navbar, black background to highlight images of space objects, which convey sophistication and provide a pleasant user experience.
I used the two icons on the home page to clarify what the user should do when they first come to the page, I made them clicable so that the user is taken to the content by pressing at the same time by moving the mouse over the text "Explore" text changes color to orange letting the user know that the action can achieve something.

### Typography
The main font used in this project is **Robotto**. I think that's a well designed and easy to read font. An extra reason for using this font is the excellent display on small screens.
In the main titles of the site and logo the font **Girassol** was used, which also has a good design and combines nicely with the main font.

### Colours

- In the colour scheme, i used black, orange and white which combined together give me favoured the easy visualization of the information.

- Transparent rounded navbar with orange border and same style is used for footer to greater contrast and to get pleasant ux.

- Transparent callout section with white text and orange seperators for text and that style is constantly used through all pages.

- In the background, I used an black-blue image of the galaxy for callout section and black universe image for planet section which provide me great ground for planets to "float".

- The orange buttons continue and blend in with the black-and-orange design, changing the color to a lighter shade on hover.


#### Colors used on site can see [here.](/assets/images/readme/colors.png)

### Icons

## Existing Features

### Responsiveness
  The biggest feature of this site is the responsiveness across devices and screen sizes that we have achieved using [Bootstrap 4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/overview/) layout. 
  So with small screens or mobile phones we have one planet per column on medium screens as tablets we have two planets per column while on desktop and larger screens we have four planets per column which led to better visibility, organization, readability and better visual presentation.

* Small screens, medium screens,large screens.

The left hand side has the logo of the page being "Sp@ce F@cts", and when clicked, will return the user to the home page. The rest of the navigation items are centred to middle of the Navigation bar and they are: **Home**, **About us** and **Planets** which is also a drop down menu and change shape to three lines called "Burger" for mobile screens.
