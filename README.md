  Hello everyone welcome to Sp@ce F@cts your new favorite space app.
 
  Sp@ce F@cts was started in April 2020 as educational school project.
 
  The site itself is educational and was created out of love  and hobbies. Its purpose is to share information about the universe. Page will be updated over time and i would like to keep the design as much as possible as it is right now. Nice simple black background with high resolution pictures to highlight all the beauty, intrigue and incredible appearance of some objects in space.

  I am thrilled that I can turn my passion and hobby into my own website. I hope you enjoy my web page as much as I enjoy presenting space facts to you all.

#### You can access the application [here.](https://ivantepes.github.io/Space-Facts/)
